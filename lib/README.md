# Broadcast Worker
This is our broadcaster.js worker script for handling the broadcasting in a mutlithreaded manner to support multiple broadcasts simultanously without issue


The example.js and start.js are some basic documentations on how i can start them in different manners i eventually came up with different scheme but those are still useful snippets for anyone so i feel i should leave them there.
