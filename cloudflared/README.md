# cloudflared

A Node.js package that allows you to easily create HTTPS tunnels using Cloudflare's `cloudflared` command-line tool. It provides a typed API for creating tunnels and managing the `cloudflared` binary installation.

> This tool will automatically install the [latest version of `cloudflared`](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases/latest) (or `CLOUDFLARED_VERSION` env var if exists) at the first time.
> Then, it just passes down the command to `cloudflared`.
